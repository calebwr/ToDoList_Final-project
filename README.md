To Do List
-----------

I am going to create a To Do list where you can add items to a list. You will also be able to search for a to do item. You will
also be able to set a date and time to remind you to do that specific item and you will be able to delete to do items off of the
list.

Each to do item will have following properties:

- <li> - each item will be in a li element
- id - a string that uniquely identifies an item

Possible future properties:

- authentication - have users log in using google
- due date - be able to set a due date when the item needs to be done
- database - use a database to store the information in
- folders - be able to create folders and add to do items in different folders
- users can search for a to do item

Features
---------

- Users can create, read, update, and delete to do items


Approach
---------

To Do List is an Express web application that uses Handlebars for templates and memory to store items

Routes
-------

- / - The 'index' route. Show a list of the to do items


Additional routes will be added as more features are developed.
